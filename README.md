# Databases Coursework

These SQLite queries were written for an assignment from Imperial College London's Databases 70040 module as part of the MSc in Computing.

Questions are as follows:

```
1. Find all films that are not in the inventory and count them
2. Count the number of transactions each staff has been processing and find the staff member (id) with the biggest number of transactions and also the
staff member with the biggest sum of the transaction value.
3. Find all stores with more than 300 customers. Report the ID of the store.
4. Find all customers who spent more than 200. Report the ID of the customer
as well as the sum spent.
5. Find the films whose rental rate is higher than the average rental rate. Use
a subquery and count the number of films.
6. Find films that have return date between 2005-05-29 and 2005-05-30 and
report the movie titles. Use a subquery.
